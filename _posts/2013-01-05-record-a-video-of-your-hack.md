Fix your bugs, polish things up, but perhaps most importantly: Record a video of your hack working in action.</p>

<p>There are always bugs and sometimes it's hard for the judges to use a hack -- a video allows everyone to understand how the hack works and to see it in action. The video can be simple, it can be a screencast... just record a video and include it on your project details!</p>
