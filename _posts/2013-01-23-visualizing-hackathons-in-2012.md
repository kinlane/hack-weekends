<p>Hackathons have been going on for quite a few years now, in Silicon Valley circles.  But in 2012 hackathons started going mainstream around the globe, getting a lot of attention because of organizers like Twilio, Sendgrid, AT&amp;T, AngelHack, to name just a few.</p>
<p>For those that are new to the hackathon space, these events are not intended to perform illegal activities around computer networks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Software developers widely see hacking as a quick and dirty programmatic solution to a problem.</em></strong></p>
<p>Hackathons are NOT about gaining access to other networks, which is a definition widely publicized by the media and hollywood.  Among the developer community, it is meant to be a positive term that drives innovation among developers.</p>
<p>While many hackathons are startup focused, we are seeing them emerge in other verticals like healthcare, education, environment and robotics.  People are seeing hackathons as temporary venues for innovation and R&amp;D as well as potential environments for talent acquisition.</p>
<p>This time last year, I was going to 10 hackathons a month, doing research on the space, which resulted in me spending the entire year tracking on hackathons--then organizing the data into a central database, which I publish weekly to <a href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>, <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and other venues.</p>
<p>Over the holidayz I partnered with Singly to help visualize the hackathons in 2012. Even though some of the data was a little messy, I think we were able to produce a nice overview of the year, when and where hackathons occur as well as some of the top genres of hackathons from mobile to gaming.</p>
