<p>While assembling the <a title="Hack Weekends Calendar" href="http://hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends calendar</a>&nbsp;each week, I see a wide variety of Hackathons, in different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>The most common perception of what a hackathon is, comes from the precedent set by <a title="Startup Weekend" href="http://startupweekend.com">Startup Weekend</a>.  While a great model, there are plenty of other incarnations out there that deserve attention.</p>
<p>One interesting example I came across today is out of Santa Cruz, called <a title="TechRaising" href="http://techraising.com/">TechRaising</a>.</p>
<p>I think they describe it best:</p>
<blockquote><em> We aim to provide the space and support for individuals to gather, collaborate, build, promote, and gain momentum for their ideas. While TechRaisers build tech, many people who participate are not technical. It is the melding of diversity of experience, background, technical, non technical, online, in real life, opinions, and the open flow of knowledge and expertise that allows tech projects to flourish. </em></blockquote>
<p>TechRaising was founded in 2011 to support local communities to create sustaining tech ecosytems, developing a model that could be used by any community around the world.</p>

<p>Hackathons aren&rsquo;t just about young, male programmers coming together to build the next Facebook--hackathons can be about a community coming together to solve everyday problems, and possibly generate new community driven businesses.</p>
<p>TechRaising is having an <a href="http://techraisingfall2012.eventbrite.com/">event October 19th in Santa Cruz</a>, starting at 6PM, make sure and check it out!</p><h3>Tags:</h3>Civic, Community, TechRaising</div>
