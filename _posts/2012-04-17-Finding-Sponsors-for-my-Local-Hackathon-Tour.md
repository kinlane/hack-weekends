<p>I&rsquo;m currently planning a 9 city hackathon tour, starting with the <a href="http://citygridhackathonla.eventbrite.com/">CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon</a>, and following up with Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Austin.</p>
<p>The CityGrid Hackathon tour is meant to bring together commercial and civic hackers to build the next generation of apps we use in our everyday "local" lives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a blend of developers, business, marketing and advertising folks that will come together and develop commercially viable ideas that can also make our cities better places to live.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for sponsors that really enhance the local theme of the event, so I started with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Local API Stack" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/tag/stack/">Local API Stack</a></strong> - These are APIs that I track on for CityGrid, providing direct value to local mobile and web app developers.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Back-end as a Service Providers" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup/">Mobile Back-end as a Service</a></strong> - Service providers that exclusively provide back-end platforms and tools for mobile developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy if all of these companies could provide the sponsorships that I need to support the event, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough.  So I&rsquo;m looking elsewhere with some of the usual suspects like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace and Twilio.</p>
<p>Regardless of what my sponsor line-up looks like I think I will still provide a directory of local APIs for developers to use, so that they have a robust listing of high quality APIs to choose from when building their local web and mobile apps.</p>
