The event brought developers together to hack on over 9 APIs in order to build something cool over the course of a weekend.<p></p>
The event started out Friday night with <a title="Tokbox" href="http://www.opentok.com/">TokBox</a>, Ebay / <a title="Paypal" href="http://x.com/">Paypal</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="http://developer.foursquare.com/">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Box.net" href="http://box.net/developers">Box.net</a>, <a title="Twilio" href="http://twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="Genability" href="http://developer.genability.com/">Genability</a>, <a title="Factual" href="http://www.factual.com/">Factual</a>, and <a title="Mashery" href="http://developer.mashery.com/apis">Mashery</a> showcasing their companies and their APIs to developers.<p></p>
Next, developers lined up to pitch their ideas and generate interest amongst other participants.  10 ideas were pitched, then developers formed groups and got to work.<p></p>
Developers spent all weekend drinking coffee, eating pizza and bagels, and hacking away.  Everything culminated Sunday afternoon when developers presented their hacks.<p></p>
Over sixteen hacks were presented, with prizes going to the best:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>FourSquare2Go</strong> won a Foursquare prize for their offline Foursquare application.</li>
	<li><strong>Energy Dashboard </strong>won both the Mashery APIs and Genabiity API prizes for their energy insight, and prediction tool.</li>
	<li><strong>Congress Connector </strong>won multiple Twilio API, Factual API and Ebay / Paypal API prizes for their tool that made connecting with your congressional rep easier.</li>
	<li><strong>Chat Living Room</strong> won a TokBox API prize with their group Youtube video chat room.</li>
	<li><strong>Hapidocs</strong> won a Box.net API prize for their location based file storage application.</li>
	<li><strong>SoshoWise</strong> won a Ebay / Paypal API prize for their expert driven how to video application.</li>
</ul>
<a title="TokBox" href="http://www.tokbox.com/">TokBox</a> who organized the event, wanted to bring the developers together into an environment where they could make whatever they want, and offer support and prizes from nine different APIs.<p></p>
Overall the <a title="Hackathon" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/hackathons-and-contests.php">hackathon</a> was a success, with developers going home with cash and schwag, and the APIs involved generated more awareness of the services they provide.
