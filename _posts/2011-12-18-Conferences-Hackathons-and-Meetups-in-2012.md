<p>In 2012 I&rsquo;m going to be stepping up my travel schedule.  I&rdquo;m planning on attending as many conferences, hackathons and meetups as I possibly can.</p>
<p>My emphasis will be on hackathons and meetups, but there are still some very worthy larger conferences that I will make sure and be at.</p>
<p>I believe that in 2012 there will be some serious innovation occurring around Hackathons in cities around the globe, and I want to be there for as much of it as I can.</p>
<p>Tonight I added some filters to the <a title="events page" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events/">events page</a> so you can filter down by month, city, country	 and time period.  I&rsquo;m trying to make it so I can plan each month and easily plan which events I will be at.</p>
<p>You can filter and see events on the events page, and also subscribe to individuals Google Calendars for <a title="conference" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events_conference_calendar.php">conferences, </a><a title="hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events_hackathon_calendar.php">hackathons</a><span> and </span><a title="meetups" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events_meetups_calendar.php">meetups</a>.</p>
<p>I track these separately, because important conferences tend to steer where I end-up, but more often hackathons in important cities are affecting my travel decisions.  With meetups being an important way to fill my time while I&rsquo;m in a town for a conference or other hackathon.</p>
<p>These are my research tools, and I&rsquo;m doing my best to keep up to date.  Feel free to <a title="Contact Me" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/contact.php">contact me</a>, if you are having an event or know of an event I should be tracking on.</p>
