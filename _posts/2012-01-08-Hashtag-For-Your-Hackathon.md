<p>There are a lot of reasons for throwing a <a title="hackathons" href="/events/">hackathon</a>, and what value you get out of a hackathon will vary depending on who you are.</p>
<p>As I explore the hackathon phenomenom in 2012, I&rsquo;m trying to track on what value hackathon organizers, API owners, mobile platforms, developers and other participants get out of hackathons.</p>
<p>I will be tracking on the different reasons people attend hackathons throughout the year, and share my findings, but here in January I know one thing for sure--hackthons are a marketing vehicle.  Whether you are the hackathon organizer, an API provider or developer you are depending on the event to market your organization, business, API or talent and skills as a developer.</p>
<p>In future posts I will write, more about the marketing effect of hackathons, but I wanted to talk about a common mistake I&rsquo;m seeing from hacakthon organizers--no Twitter hashtag for the event.</p>
<p>A Twitter hashtag is probably the most important marketing element of your hackathon.  It should be everywhere, on your site, print materials, slides...everywhere.  A hackathon organizer should be tweeting out every aspect of the event with the hashtag, before, during and after the event.</p>
<p>The hashtag will enable sponsors and other participating businesses to market themselves around the event.  It will also allow hackathon developers to showcase their ideas, skills and applications.</p>
<p>While researching hackathons I have to spend a lot of time tracking down the event hashtag, and many times I have to ask an event organizer to provide it, and often there isn&rsquo;t even one.</p>
<p>If your organizing an hackathon, make sure and establish a unique Twitter hashtag for event right away, and use it everywhere, everyone involved will benefit, and your event will be much more successful.</p>
