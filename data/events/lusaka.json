{"events":[{"name":"Hackathon on Mobile Apps for Equitable Access to Quality Health Care","about":"<p><span>Reports from the health sector on the status of health for the majority of Zambians point to notable reductions in infant and maternal mortality rates and in the disease burden in general. Reductions have been recorded in the prevalence of malaria, HIV\/AIDS infections and TB transmissions, among others. However, these successes appear not to be commensurate with the newly acquired status of a lower middle income country. Further, a concern has arisen that Zambia may not achieve its health targets under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Policy makers and experts attribute this to a weak health delivery system and are convinced that mainstreaming ICTs in the system could enhance its effectiveness and hence Zambia&rsquo;s chances of attaining the MDGs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>In an effort to contribute to this subject, the Southern Africa Innovation Support (SAIS) Programme is promoting public discussions aimed at sharing knowledge on how best to improve the health delivery system in Zambia through the use of ICTs, specifically mobile phone technology.
