Beginning with Friday night pitches and continuing through brainstorming, business plan development, and basic prototype creation, Startup Weekends culminate in Sunday night demos and presentations.\u00a0 Participants create working startups during the event and are able to collaborate with like-minded individuals outside of their daily networks.\u00a0All teams hear talks by industry leaders and receive valuable feedback from local entrepreneurials.\u00a0The weekend is centered around action, innovation, and education. Whether you are looking for feedback on a idea, a co-founder, specific skill sets, or a team to help you execute, Startup Weekends are the perfect environment in which to test your idea and take the first steps towards launching your own startup.<\/SPAN><\/P>\n<\/DIV>\n<\/DIV>\n<\/DIV>\n<\/DIV>\n<\/BLOCKQUOTE>\n<\/DIV>\n<\/DIV>\n<\/DIV>","start_date":"Sep 29 2012 19:00:00","display_start_date":"09-29-2012","end_date":"Oct 01 2012 22:00:00","display_end_date":"10-01-2012","url":"http:\/\/columbiastartupweekend-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"3500 Buttonwood Dr Array","city":"Columbia","state":"MO","zip":"65201","country":"United States"},{"name":"Hack for Good","about":"<P>Hack for Good<\/P>\n<P>12-hour hackathon<\/P>\n<P>June 22-23<\/P>\n<P>6:00p-6:00a<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0<\/P>\n<P>Hack for Good is a community-focused event for developers.
