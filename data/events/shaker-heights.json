The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the worlds largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today&rsquo;s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don&rsquo;t code can contribute to a game.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><span>We will be holding the event at the Shaker|LaunchHouse startup&nbsp;<\/span><span>incubator. LaunchHouse (<a href=http:\/\/launchhouse.com\/>http:\/\/launchhouse.com<\/a>) is a lean new&nbsp;<\/span><span>public-private partnership that fosters entrepreneurial success and&nbsp;<\/span><span>job creation through seed capital, education and innovation. This N<\/span><span>ortheast Ohio organization connects new entrepreneurs with proven&nbsp;<\/span><span>business leaders in a grassroots, for-profit model that can be&nbsp;<\/span><span>successfully replicated nationwide. This is an exciting and unique&nbsp;<\/span><span>space that will give our group plenty of room to work. Please note&nbsp;<\/span><span>that we will only be using the LaunchHouse space during the hours&nbsp;<\/span><span>specified below. We will not be able to provide sleeping locations or&nbsp;<\/span><span>overnight access to the facility.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>It is&nbsp;<\/span><span>recommended that people interested in working within a team&nbsp;<\/span><span>form it in advance. Participants will need to bring their own laptops&nbsp;<\/span><span>or desktops and whatever software or technology they need for creating&nbsp;<\/span><span>games. Wifi Internet access will be available. Participants also have the option to build &ldquo;paper prototype&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/span><span>games using whatever supplies they wish to bring.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong><span>Location:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/><span>Shaker|LaunchHouse<\/span><br \/><span>3558 Lee Road<\/span><br \/><span>Shaker Heights, OH 44120<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong><span>Location Hours:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/><span>Friday, January 25th - 5:00 PM to 1:00 AM<\/span><br \/><span>Saturday, January 26th - 10:00 AM to 1:00 AM<\/span><br \/><span>Sunday, January 27th - 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><strong><span>Event Times:<\/span><\/strong><\/span><br \/><span>Keynotes and Theme Announcement start at 6:00 PM Friday<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Project Demos start at 3:00 PM Sunda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Contact Info:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Please contact Matt Perrin, Organizer for the Cleveland Game<\/span><br \/><span>Developers Meetup group if you have any questions or concerns.<\/span><br \/><span>Email : mattperrin at gmail.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Event Rules:<\/span><\/strong><br \/><span>This event is for individuals over 18 years of age with a valid photo&nbsp;<\/span><span>ID and signed liability waiver.
