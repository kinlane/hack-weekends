Designing an application based on one of three use-case scenarios below to leverage new technologies to support a functional model to complete the given task. The underlying application framework should be exposed through a set of services to empower manipulation of the application to adapt to future services.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Age 3-5 This scenario will involve designing and delivering instructional &amp; motivational content that the child finds engaging and rewarding. The content itself will be dynamic and will be expected to evolve with usage to keep the child engaged and well positioned to learn new tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Age 5-12 This scenario will revolve around basic tasks related to getting ready for going and coming back from school. It should facilitate parent and school-driven customizations based on each child&rsquo;s unique circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Age 12-20 This scenario will revolve around critical skills necessary to utilize public transit for a young adult to transport him\/herself to and from a destination. It should facilitate multiple modes of transit, integration with real-time transit data, geo- awareness of the young adult (via mobile\/tablet) and capitalize on other data available with respect to his\/her surroundings.<span style=font-size: 1.17em;>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong><span>OUTCOME<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The hackathon will be expected to generate a collection of prototypes.
