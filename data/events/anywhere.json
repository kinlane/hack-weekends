{"events":[{"name":"EcoHack","about":"<p>EcoHack is an unconference designed to bring together scientists, developers, designers, writers, and anyone interested in finding new solutions to the challenges of global environmental change. The event takes place over a single weekend, kicking off with an evening of Ignite talks where participants present data and ideas. Next, teams are formed around the most exciting topics and a day is spent hacking on data and code. Following a successful inaugural EcoHack in November, the planning committee are preparing a second event for Friday, April 20th through Saturday, April 21st. This next event is expanding further, bringing in hardware hacker and citizen science representatives, and hosting a public presentation of the results on Earth Day, April 22nd. EcoHack brings together people with the diverse skill sets to analyze data, design interfaces, develop code, write content or provide new ideas -- so, no matter your background, we are sure you have something valuable to contribute.&nbsp;<\/p>","start_date":"Apr 21 2012 02:00:00","display_start_date":"04-20-2012","end_date":"Apr 22 2012 03:00:00","display_end_date":"04-21-2012","url":"http:\/\/ecohack-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":" ","city":"Anywhere","state":"in the","zip":"","country":"World"}]}
