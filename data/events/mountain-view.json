The event will kick off at 10:00 AM on January 20th and go till the next day at 5:00 PM. Copious amounts of caffeine, pizza, and beer will be provided. Come with a team, or come on your own and join a team. Come with an idea to work on, or join our ideation session in the morning to develop an idea. At the conclusion of the event each team will present their project, and the coolest project will win some swag.<\/P>\n<P STYLE=margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 24px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.35em; text-shadow: white 0px 1px; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;>The focus of the hackathon will be trademarks. Why trademarks, you ask? We recently finished building three super valuable APIs for trademarks that we hope will enable more open innovation in the space: (i) the AF TM applications API, (ii) the AF TM attorneys API, and (iii) the AF TM logos API. Together, these three APIs should enable devs to build a slew of cool new apps to disrupt the trademark industry.<\/P>\n<P STYLE=margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 24px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.35em; text-shadow: white 0px 1px; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;>More to the point, everyone who files a trademark application does so because they believe that their name, logo, or brand will become incredibly valuable in the future and worthy of protection. In other words, people file trademarks when they are dreaming of a grandiose future, and we thought that there would be nothing more fitting than to commemorate these dreams on Martin Luther King weekend.<\/P>\n<P STYLE=margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 24px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.35em; text-shadow: white 0px 1px; color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif;>Please RSVP below so that we can make sure that our pizza procurement strategy matches headcount.
