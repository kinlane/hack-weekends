During the months leading up to the event, subject matter experts and members of the public will create, submit and vote on problem definitions that highlight specific sanitation challenges that could be mitigated by innovative ICTs. Then, during a weekend-long marathon event, teams of programmers in cities around the world will develop innovative solutions to these problem definitions.&nbsp;To see the problem statements already submitted please click&nbsp;<a title=Problem statements href=http:\/\/www.sanitationhackathon.org\/problems>here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/www.sanitationhackathon.org\/node>Sanitation Hackathon<\/a>&nbsp;emerges out of the recognition that the rapid increase of penetration, awareness and literacy in information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the developing world can transform water and sanitation management. Mobile phones, the Internet and open data are creating new entry points to make sanitation services more transparent, inclusive and participatory while forging new connections between the government, its citizens and the private sector.<\/p>\n<p>Solutions developed over the weekend hackathon may be any kind of software application, be it for the web, a personal computer, a mobile handheld device, console, SMS, or any software platform broadly available to the public.
