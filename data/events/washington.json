Stay tuned.<\/p>\n<p>This event is being organized by Josh Tauberer (GovTrack) and Eric Mill (Sunlight Foundation).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Last year...<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The last open data day hackathon in DC was on Dec. 3, 2011. It was co-hosted by POPVOX (Josh Tauberer) and Wikimedia DC (Katie Filbert). See what we did on the post-event recap at<a href=https:\/\/www.popvox.com\/features\/opendataday2011>https:\/\/www.popvox.com\/features\/opendataday2011<\/a>. The theme of our hackathon was open government data, and participants worked on improving access to U.S. law, scanning federal spending for anomalies following Benford&rsquo;s Law, understanding farm subsidy grants, building local transit apps, and keeping Congress accountable. Only about half of the participants were programmers, but everyone found a way to be involved.<\/p>","start_date":"Feb 23 2013 17:00:00","display_start_date":"02-23-2013","end_date":"Feb 24 2013 02:00:00","display_end_date":"02-23-2013","url":"http:\/\/opendataday2013dc-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"","city":"Washington","state":"DC","zip":"","country":"United States"},{"name":"Startups at Black Colleges: Hackathon Tour - DC","about":"<p><span><strong><span>Have an idea for an app?
