{"events":[{"name":"GoInstant node.js Hackathon v2.0","about":"<p><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.6684305630624294><span>Want to build awesome interactive web apps? Well, here&rsquo;s your shot! On Saturday, February 23rd, the second ever GoInstant Hackathon will be going down at our fancy new offices on Barrington Street, and it&rsquo;s all about the nodes. Node.js, that is. You can win sweet prizes, get lots of high fives, and consume free pizza and beer - all for free.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>If you&rsquo;re a dev who uses or wants to learn more about node.js, this is the Hackathon for you. And if you&rsquo;re a web designer who has great ideas for web apps, then get on board. This day will be all about building beautiful and amazing things.<\/span><br \/><br \/><span>The Schedule<\/span><br \/><\/strong><span><strong>Intro<\/strong>: 11:00-11:30AM. Our superwizard CTO Gavin Uhma will talk a little bit about GoInstant and the tech that makes it run - like node.js.<\/span><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.6684305630624294><br \/><\/strong><span><strong>Pitch<\/strong>: &nbsp;11:30AM-12:00PM. You don&rsquo;t need to pitch a million dollar idea (though that&rsquo;s pretty cool too), and you dont need to pitch an idea at all. We just want to see the best, craziest, most awesome web app you can make with limited time and resources, and this is where you&rsquo;ll sell the other devs on your vision.<\/span><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.6684305630624294><br \/><\/strong><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.6684305630624294><strong>Get a team<\/strong><span>: 12:00-12:30PM. Well put the pitches up on the wall, and participants will have a chance to put their names down for the ones theyre most interested in.<br \/><\/span><strong>Lunch<\/strong><span>: 12:30-1:00PM. Everyone has to eat, so sit down with your new pals and enjoy a sandwich.<\/span><br \/><\/strong><span><strong>Hack<\/strong>: 1:00-9:00PM. After pitching your web app idea, you&rsquo;ll have around 8 hours to build a web-based app to do whatever you want it to. A little after 5PM, we&rsquo;ll break for free pizza.<\/span><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.6684305630624294><br \/><\/strong><span><strong>Presentations and awards<\/strong>: 9:30-10:00PM. Tell us what you made! After some deliberations, we&rsquo;ll be giving out prizes to our winners. As if that&rsquo;s not enough, there&rsquo;ll be free beer too. And did I mention that the whole day is free to all comers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.6684305630624294><br \/><span>So what are you waiting for?
