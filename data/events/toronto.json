{"events":[{"name":"Blind Tennis Hackathon -- Building a Better Ball","about":"<p>Blind Tennis Hackathon -- Building a Better Ball<\/p>\n<p class=MsoNormal><span>This workshop is ideal for anyone interested in hacking tennis balls, sensors, or blind tennis. Blind tennis is much like sighted tennis except that the ball makes noise so that a blind or partially sighted player can track and return it. The ball that players currently use contains a rattle, so the sound it makes is intermittent. In addition, the movement of the rattle can affect the trajectory of the ball in unexpected ways. The aim of our workshop is to change that. Well investigate hacks along several tracks. First, mechanical hacks such as whistles or more balanced rattles. Second, electronic hacks ranging from a constant tone emitter to more complex solution involving sensors like accelerometers or gyroscopes. And third, methods of mounting our apparatus into balls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=MsoNormal><span>Lunch will be provided.&nbsp;Those interested in sensors should bring their own laptops.&nbsp;Registration is $20 to cover materials and food.<br \/><br \/><br \/><\/span><\/p>","start_date":"Dec 01 2012 18:00:00","display_start_date":"12-01-2012","end_date":"Dec 02 2012 00:00:00","display_end_date":"12-01-2012","url":"http:\/\/blindtennis-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"130 St George St","city":"Toronto","state":"Ontario","zip":"M5S 3H1","country":"Canada"},{"name":"AngelHack Fall 2012 Toronto: Michigan Hackers Edition","about":"<div style=font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;>\n<div style=color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;>\n<div style=color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div><span><strong><span>15\/11 UPDATE:&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span>Good news everyone!&nbsp;<strong>Ticket sales reopened.<\/strong>&nbsp;With the help of the fantastic folks at&nbsp;<span><strong><a href=http:\/\/www.theburroughes.com\/><span>the Burroughes<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/span>, we now have access to the 6th floor!<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span><span>- Shaharris<\/span><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span><span><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div><strong>********<\/strong><\/div>\n<div><span><span><span><strong>13\/11 UPDATE:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span>Maxxed out!
