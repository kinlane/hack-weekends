And the best part is that you actually get to be part of building stuff for real. It is a fast paced weekend where you will be thrown into tasks you might never have done before &mdash; an excellent opportunity to learn new skills. StartupWeekend is coming to Trondheim for the second time.<\/p>\n<p>I bet you wonder how it all works. We start the weekend with an open microphone session where project ideas are pitched. If your brilliant idea is not ready yet, don&rsquo;t worry &mdash; pitching is optional. The most popular projects are found by voting. You are free to join any team\/project you like. Throughout the weekend we have mentors, facilitating the teams, and there will be small workshops about entrepreneurship. StartupWeekend has a focus on lean startup methodology. You will learn to do market validation, customer development, and your team will build a minimum viable product. At the end of the weekend you have the chance to win amazing prices from our sponsors.<\/p>\n<p>Participants are a mix of all kinds of professions and students. Anybody with an interest in entrepreneurship are welcome to join. Typical backgrounds are engineers, designers, economists, students, doctors, humanist.
