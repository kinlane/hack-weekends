It will begin on October 13th at 2:00pm and conclude on October 14th at 3:00pm EST. We will have several companies presenting their technologies so that students can create original applications in unique and interesting ways. Last year, we had over 150 students in attendance, and we are aiming to double the turnout this year.<\/span><br style=font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; \/><br style=font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; \/><span style=font-family: Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;>This event is open to anyone willing to spend the weekend hacking for honor and glory. There is no limit to the size of a team but remember that the bigger the team, the harder it is to manage a project. We are looking forward to seeing some awesome hacks and some awesome hackers.<\/span><\/p>","start_date":"Oct 13 2012 21:00:00","display_start_date":"10-13-2012","end_date":"Oct 14 2012 22:00:00","display_end_date":"10-14-2012","url":"http:\/\/hackru2012-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"100 George St","city":"New Brunswick","state":"NJ","zip":"08901","country":"United States"}]}
