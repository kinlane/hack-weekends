{"events":[{"name":"HackRU: A Scarlet Knight of Hacking","about":"<p>The Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists at Rutgers will be hosting its annual hackathon &ldquo;hackRU: A Scarlet Night of Hacking&rdquo; for the second year in a row!<br \/><br \/>The event is a 24-hour hackathon. It will begin on April 21th at 11:00am and conclude on April 22th at 3:00pm EST. We will have several companies presenting their technologies so that students can create original applications in unique and interesting ways. Last year, we had over 150 students in attendance, and we are aiming to double the turnout this year.<br \/><br \/>This event is open to anyone willing to spend the weekend hacking for honor and glory. There is no limit to the size of a team but remember that the bigger the team, the harder it is to manage a project. We are looking forward to seeing some awesome hacks and some awesome hackers.<br \/><br \/>Schedule:<br \/><br \/>April 21th Saturday:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>11:00am: Registration starts and lunch served<\/li>\n<li>12:00 noon: API Presentations<\/li>\n<li>2:00pm: Hacking begins.<\/li>\n<li>6:00pm: Dinner served<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>April 22th Sunday:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>12:00 midnight: Midnight Meal<\/li>\n<li>3:00am: 3:00am Surprise<\/li>\n<li>8:00am: Breakfast served<\/li>\n<li>12:00pm: Hacking ends, all hacks must be submitted on hackerleague.<\/li>\n<li>1:00pm: Demo presentations start<\/li>\n<li>2:30pm: Winners are chosen.<\/li>\n<li>3:00pm: hackRU ends<\/li>\n<\/ul>","start_date":"Apr 21 2012 18:00:00","display_start_date":"04-21-2012","end_date":"Apr 22 2012 22:00:00","display_end_date":"04-22-2012","url":"http:\/\/rutgershackathon.eventbrite.com","address":"110 Frelinghuysen Road","city":"Piscataway","state":"NJ","zip":"08854","country":"United States"}]}
