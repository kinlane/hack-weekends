These datasets will be available for you to use in your apps or you can find your own datasets on web services like Twitter, Foursquare and Craigslist.<\/P>\n<P>Some ideas to get you going:<\/P>\n<UL>\n<LI>What I love about Reno microblogging site (Think Twitter for Reno praise)<\/LI>\n<LI>Local Event aggregation website<\/LI>\n<LI>Local directory of bike shops<\/LI>\n<LI>Reno Farmers Market iPhone app\u00a0<\/LI>\n<\/UL>\n<P><STRONG>WHERE CAN YOU LEARN MORE?<\/STRONG><\/P>\n<P>Come to Hacknight at Reno Collective on November 14th at 5:30pm to mingle with other hackathoners, developers, makers and creatives before the big event!<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0<\/P>\n<P><STRONG>STAY UP TO DATE<\/STRONG><\/P>\n<P>Get up to the minute updates on Facebook (search for Hack4Reno) or Twitter (<A HREF=http:\/\/twitter.com\/hack4reno TARGET=_blank>@hack4reno<\/A>).<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0<\/P>\n<P><STRONG> WHAT IF I AM NOT A DEVELOPER OR DESIGNER, BUT WANT TO GET INVOLVED?<\/STRONG><\/P>\n<P>We want to be as open and transparent as possible but we also want people to come down and see what goes into building websites and mobile apps!
