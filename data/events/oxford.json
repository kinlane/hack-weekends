All teams hear talks by industry leaders and receive valuable feedback from local entrepreneurials. The weekend is centered around action, innovation, and education.  Whether you are looking for feedback on a idea, a co-founder, specific skill sets, or a team to help you execute, Startup Weekends are the perfect environment in which to test your idea and take the first steps towards launching your own startup.<\/p>","start_date":"Feb 11 2012 01:00:00","display_start_date":"02-10-2012","end_date":"Feb 13 2012 04:00:00","display_end_date":"02-12-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/event\/2110758335","address":" University of Miami Ohio","city":"Oxford","state":"OH","zip":"","country":"United States"}]}
