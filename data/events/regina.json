We are interested in working with you to build a bigger, stronger developer community in Regina, and were open to other creative ideas - so get in touch!<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>FAQ<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>So what are HackDays?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/ target=_blank>HackDays<\/a>&nbsp;are daily hackathons that&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/about\/ target=_blank>we<\/a>&nbsp;organize across Canada. We gather an awesome group of hackers\/developers who work either in a team or alone to build applications with publicly available APIs. We started with&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackto.ca\/ target=_blank>HackTO<\/a>&nbsp;in Toronto and had such a great time that we decided to roll out our hackathons across Canada. Our first destination outside of Toronto was Montreal. HackMTL was a&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/mtl.hackdays.ca\/2010\/12\/09\/hackmtl-was-a-blast-montreal-represented\/ target=_blank>blast<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/2011\/03\/hackott-ottawa-represented\/ target=_blank>HackOTT<\/a>&nbsp;and HackWaterloo followed hot on its heels! &nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/2012\/03\/hackregina-winners\/>Our last HackREGINA event<\/a>&nbsp;was March 17, 2012 and had 35 developers create 14 applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would like to participate, what do I need?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First you need to register (right here on this page).&nbsp;This will ensure that you are guaranteed a spot for the hackathon. There is a $10 registration fee. This provides you with access to the event, breakfast, lunch, drinks, snacks and participation with awesome developers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who can participate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anyone who is interested in building an application. All you need to bring with you is your interest and motivation to get involved in building an application in a single day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Am I allowed to use third party APIs (APIs not provided via HackREGINA) to build my application?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. But your usage of the third party APIs needs to be in addition to the HackREGINA APIs. Also keep in mind that judging is partially based on utilization of the provided APIs, though, so their use should be prominent. So you can use any API you wish to use during HackREGINA as long as you use at least one of the provided APIs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why should I participate in this hackathon?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question! When&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/about\/ target=_blank>Leila and Corey<\/a>&nbsp;started organizing hacking events in Toronto, they enjoyed meeting other like minded people, they enjoyed connecting them to other awesome people and learning about their interests, startups, and applications. They realized that everyone had a lot in common but most importantly: we were all builders. You want to participate because you are a builder and because you can&rsquo;t imagine a better use for your Saturday then setting yourself up in an awesome environment, surrounded by like minded people, building an application to stretches your tech skills, imagination and interests. That&rsquo;s why. You can always watch TV another day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if I don&rsquo;t know anyone or if I don&rsquo;t have any ideas as to what to build?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh that&rsquo;s an easy one: if you don&rsquo;t know anyone, that will last about 10 seconds once you join us. Seriously. Just come out and give it a try. I know you are shy and sometimes you need a kick in the a**. Consider this the kick in the a**. And as to ideas: not to worry, there will be plenty to choose from. The better question: will you have enough time to build your application and showcase it to the judges at the end of the day?<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if I have an idea and a team already?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, we want to see you at HackREGINA. That&rsquo;s a great start. Bring your team. Bring your idea. And get working as soon as you get to HackREGINA. Perhaps we will be able to witness the birth of your startup.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How large can my team be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Teams can be as large or as small as you like. Solo is okay, too. A 2-3 people team is ideal typically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now I love hacking events but what do I win if I build the best application ever?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HackREGINA is not just all guts. There is glory and prizes!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What shall I expect when I get to HackREGINA? What shall I bring and what does the schedule look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Expect that you will be spending the day with 49 other developers who are as keen as you are to build an application in a day and compete. This is a competition too after all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to bring:<\/strong><strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp; \n<ul>\n<li>Your laptop<\/li>\n<li>Your mobile device if you are developing a mobile app<\/li>\n<li>Cables, chargers and connectors for any of the above<\/li>\n<li>Your data stick if you have one &ndash; could come in handy when networks get choked up&nbsp;<img src=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif alt=:) \/><\/li>\n<li>Your sense of humor and your ability to get along with everyone while in tight quarters!<\/li>\n<li>Your portable coffee cup &ndash; we try to keep disposables to a minimum in our events.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>What we will provide:<\/strong><strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp; \n<ul>\n<li>APIs, API support<\/li>\n<li>Breakfast<\/li>\n<li>Lunch<\/li>\n<li>Coffee, tea, juice, pop<\/li>\n<li>Snacks and beers at beer o&rsquo;clock<\/li>\n<li>Wireless access<\/li>\n<li>A large LCD display for presentations, with HDMI and VGA input (we recommend you bring your own connectors, but we will have some handy as well)<\/li>\n<li>Smiles!<\/li>\n<li>An awesome developer community!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span>Sponsors<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We thank our incredible sponsors for supporting HackDays and HackREGINA.
