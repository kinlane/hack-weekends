A course companion app could allow students to easily track progress, access multimedia, and practice vocabulary outside the classroom. The app could contribute to students&rsquo; personal and professional development by offering tips on how to apply what they learn in class, along with prompts to begin enriching conversations with classmates, family, and community members.
