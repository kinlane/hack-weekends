And we have a very special event planned for Saturday 20th October in association with our friends Farset Labs, Belfasts only hackerspace.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>There are a lot of questions around investigative journalism and its future, such as: Who will pay for it? Can it find a sustainable business model? One person asking those questions is Bobbie Johnson. Bobbie was the European Editor of Gigaom, a popular technology news site. He didnt want investigative reporting to die out. And the quality of reporting in the tech blogosphere was dire. He decided to do something about it. Along with a friend, freelance journalist Jim Giles, he launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a new experiment, Matter. Matters mission is to publish longform investigative journalism about science and technology across smartphone, tablet, e-reader and desktop devices. Readers pay 99p for each story.<br \/><br \/>Matters Kickstarter goal was $50,000. They cleared it in 38 hours, going on to raise over $140,000. Since then, the Matter team have been hard at work, commissioning stories and getting ready to start publishing. Bobbie will talk at HacksHackers Belfast about his journey as an entrepreneurial journalist and Matters future plans. The event will kick off at 4pm on Saturday 20th October in Farset Labs, Weavers Court Business Park, Belfast. Bobbies talk will be followed by a 20 minute Q &amp; A. Food and drink will be served. If youd like to sponsor the event, please contact Lyra McKee via email: lyra@muckraker.me.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>The event is open to everyone, from journalists to students to technologists. However, we are expecting a big crowd so admittance to the event is by ticket only.&nbsp;<\/p>","start_date":"Oct 20 2012 23:00:00","display_start_date":"10-20-2012","end_date":"Oct 21 2012 01:00:00","display_end_date":"10-20-2012","url":"http:\/\/hhbelfast-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"Unit 1, Weavers Court Business Park Linfield Road","city":"Belfast","state":"Belfast","zip":"BT12 5GH","country":"United Kingdom"},{"name":"Hacking Crime: HacksHackers Belfast Inaugural Hackathon","about":"<P>Hacking Crime: HacksHackers Belfasts inaugural hackathon.
