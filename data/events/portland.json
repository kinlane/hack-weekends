It is the largest community of passionate entrepreneurs with over 400 past events in 100 countries around the world in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The non-profit organization is headquartered in Seattle, Washington but Startup Weekend organizers and facilitators can be found in over 200 cities around the world. From Mongolia to South Africa to London to Brazil, people around the globe are coming together for weekend long workshops to pitch ideas, form teams, and start companies.<\/p>\n<h3>Got an idea? Join us for Startup Weekend at PSU!<\/h3>\n<h3>Dont have an idea? Join us for Startup Weekend at PSU!<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you have an idea or not, Startup Weekend is an experience for anyone who wants to be part of creating a new business or developing a technology. In teams and with the help of coaches and advisors from the Portland business community, youll do everything from refining the concept to validating the market, contacting customers, building the business model, forecasting revenues and expenses, developing a prototype, to creating your pitch.<\/p>\n<p>All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: everyone gathers Friday evening to hear pitches made by anyone with a startup idea (Remember! You dont need to have an idea to participate!). Weve seen a variety of ideas from the most creative apps to flame-retardant racing suits to nonprofit organizations. The diversity in backgrounds and talents makes for the collaboration and innovation extremely high quality. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it&rsquo;s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, market validation and team execution.

Everyday, apps like yours could control how to send their data out into the world to circulate and bring back value to users. Certainly this would require a change in the way the world views data today, and in the infrastructure that enables it to flow freely while protected. This event is a first step in building that infrastructure for the benefit of all.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the prospect of Facebook, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn and other data silos bidding against each other for what data you might provide. What kinds of data might be the most interesting? How could that value be enhanced? How could you collect it with minimal effort? &nbsp;How would your privacy be protected? What could you get in return?<\/p>\n<p>At this event you&rsquo;ll pick a particular type of personal data and build an app to show how its value as a personal asset can be enhanced. The app can be mobile, desktop, web or something else.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Portland is city of amazing creative energy. This event will bring together developers, managers, designers and entrepreneurs of talent and vision to spend a day exploring the opportunities. It will be a day of learning, networking, teaming up and creating. At the end, teams will pitch their ideas and demos to a panel of judges. There will be food, drink and cash prizes.<\/p>\n<p>#vdatpdx<\/p>\n<h2>Prizes<\/h2>\n<p>There will be a total $12k in prize money in various categories.
