In this spirit, Baltimore will hold Art Bytes, a hackathon where technology and creative communities work together to build programs and applications inspired by art or to address specific challenges faced by museums. This will be Baltimore\u2019s, and perhaps the nation\u2019s, first art museum hackathon.\u00a0<\/P>\n<P>This event will be at the Walters Art Museum from July 27\u2013July 29. On Friday evening, July 27, staff from Baltimore\u2019s museum community will present specific challenges or ideas that they would like solved\u2014from how to use technology to experience a collection to how to virtually access archives. Over the course of the weekend, technologists, innovators, scholars and artists will coalesce into teams in the Walters\u2019 Sculpture Court to design and develop their solution. Participants will be able to visit the museum\u2019s galleries for inspiration throughout the weekend. On Sunday afternoon, July 29, leaders of the technology and innovation communities will judge which teams were the most successful. The experience of Art Bytes will be captured on video, and the team solutions displayed at Walters the following week.<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0<\/P>\n<P>Where:\u00a0The Walters Art Museum, Sculpture Court<\/P>\n<P>When:\u00a0Friday, July 27\u2013Sunday, July 29<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Friday, July 27, 5\u20139 p.m.<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Saturday, July 28, 10 a.m.\u2013midnight<\/P>\n<P>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sunday, July 29, 10 a.m.\u20135 p.m.<\/P>\n<P>Price:\u00a0Free<\/P>","start_date":"Jul 28 2012 00:00:00","display_start_date":"07-27-2012","end_date":"Jul 30 2012 00:00:00","display_end_date":"07-29-2012","url":"http:\/\/artbytes-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"600 N Charles St Array","city":"Baltimore","state":"MD","zip":"21201","country":"United States"},{"name":"Baltimore Hackathon 2012","about":"<P>Come out and hack away on any hardware or software project and show it off for a chance to win prizes. \u00a0A ticket includes a t-shirt and food for the weekend!<\/P>\n<P>See the <A HREF=http:\/\/baltimorehackathon.com>baltimorehackathon.com<\/A>\u00a0website for more details and a link to the previous hackathons prizes and winners.<\/P>","start_date":"Jun 09 2012 01:00:00","display_start_date":"06-08-2012","end_date":"Jun 11 2012 01:00:00","display_end_date":"06-10-2012","url":"http:\/\/baltimorehackathon2012-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"1020 Hull Street 1st Floor Ivory Building","city":"Baltimore","state":"","zip":"21230","country":"United States"},{"name":"Advanced Application Development Day","about":"<p><strong>Build Bigger and Better Applications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Are you an experienced or advanced developer with over 5 years of developing applications for consumers or businesses, desktop or mobile?<\/p>\n<p>Join us for a day long seminar, presentations, and a hack-a-thon to test your skills. &nbsp;Learn something new and connect with other advanced developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested in the science and technology behind personalization?&nbsp; Do you know what the latest disruptive technology is in the area of application service delivery?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This seminar will offer AI based personalization development education and provide an introduction to Semantic Labs CubeX development platform - which can provide innovative capabilities and save you or your client hundreds of thousands of dollars in development expenses in building next generation applications.<\/p>\n<p>We want&nbsp;to help you build connections with other developers in the area and collaborate for large scale projects.&nbsp; Team up for a coding contest using information youve learned throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p>This seminar is invite only<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>","start_date":"Mar 24 2012 16:00:00","display_start_date":"03-24-2012","end_date":"Mar 25 2012 00:00:00","display_end_date":"03-24-2012","url":"http:\/\/advappdevday.eventbrite.com","address":"800 West Baltimore Street","city":"Baltimore","state":"MD","zip":"21201","country":"United States"},{"name":"CreateBaltimore Hackathon, Follow-Up, and Future Plans","about":"<p><strong id=internal-source-marker_0.1360761127434671><span>In the closing session at <a href=http:\/\/createbaltimore.org>CreateBaltimore<\/a>, lots of participants reported on their sessions and outlined possible next steps.
