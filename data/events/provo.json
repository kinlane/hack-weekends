With over 500 million Windows 8 devices slated to join the Windows ecosystem <em>this year<\/em>, there has never been a bigger opportunity for students to build an app that can get you the experience (and income!) that will help you achieve your goals.&nbsp; It also will give you a chance to show your stuff to Microsoft recruiters who will be on-site to explain why Microsoft is one of the top places to work in America, and to help you explore if were the right place for you after graduation.<\/p>\n<p>This Thursday evening&nbsp;event kicks off a month-long competition that will conclude February 22nd with an all-day Hack-a-thon where youll get expert instruction and help to finish your project, and where your app will be judged by all and valuable prizes awarded to the top apps.<\/p>\n<p>The tentative agenda for the kick-off&nbsp;is:<\/p>\n<p>6:00pm Pizza Meet and Greet with Microsoft Recruiters and Tech Evangelists<\/p>\n<p>6:30pm Windows 8: The Big Opportunity for Developers<\/p>\n<p>7:00pm App Development Workflow and Store Ecosystem<\/p>\n<p>7:30pm Overview of Visual Studio and Blend for Store Apps<\/p>\n<p>8:00pm App Dev Demos<\/p>\n<p>8:30pm Review of tutorials, how-tos, templates, and other resources<\/p>\n<p><span><span><span>This workshop is being held in a&nbsp;theater-setting&nbsp;rather than a furnished computer lab. Most of the content will be presentation-format, but it will be helpful if you bring your computer to follow-along. For the best experience attendees should have&nbsp;Windows 8 and Visual Studio installed (required to build apps). Mac Users will need to install Windows 8 and Visual Studio using Bootcamp, Parallels, or VM Ware.&nbsp; For those who arent able to do the installation before the workshop,&nbsp;we have 15 loaner USB hard drives with the required software installed, which&nbsp;we will make available for&nbsp;use&nbsp;during the evening workshop&nbsp;on a first-come, first-served basis, but please follow the preparation instructions at: <a href=http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/mis_laboratory\/archive\/2012\/08\/29\/preparing-a-computer-to-use-windows-to-go.aspx><span style=text-decoration: underline;>http:\/\/blogs.msdn.com\/b\/mis_laboratory\/archive\/2012\/08\/29\/preparing-a-computer-to-use-windows-to-go.aspx<\/span><\/a> . Attendees with older Macbooks will need to come with Windows 8 already installed using Bootcamp, VMWare&nbsp;or Parallels. Newer Macs that can boot to USB (Power + Option Key) <em>may<\/em> be able to use Windows to Go.
