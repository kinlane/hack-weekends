Our hackathon will introduce you to the latest cutting edge tools to help deploy your own app with a website backend, fully hosted in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We Supply:<\/strong>&nbsp;Quick presentations and&nbsp;code samples that help to bootstrap your hacking, food to keep you going, and caffeine to keep you awake. Along with technical senseis to assist you in building faster, smarter, and with new tools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You Bring:<\/strong>&nbsp;Your laptop, skills &amp; ideas. Come with a collaborative, team focused mindset and\/or team up in advance on Twitter\/Facebook\/Google+ via the&nbsp;<strong>#atthack&nbsp;<\/strong>hashtag. Whether you are a backend person and code in Ruby\/PHP\/.NET or are a designer and only work with Illustrator, you are invited to attend this event. Every group needs a good balance of talent and your development skills are needed!<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Event Schedule.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp; The following is a list of the weekends agenda:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>6PM - Friday Evening -&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>Kickoff event with drinks, networking, and developer dating which leads into idea pitches and team formation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>10AM - Saturday Morning -&nbsp;<\/em>&nbsp;<\/strong>The fun continues with an all day hackathon.

I mean do you really&nbsp;<em>love<\/em>&nbsp;TV? You might be a U-verse Enabled developer. With the U-verse Enabled SDK and APIs you can allow a personal device to associate itself with a U-verse set-top box. Using the UvE SDK and APIs for iOS you can develop a mobile application that can:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make pictures, video, and music play on the TV instead of on the small mobile device<\/li>\n<li>Keep your app small, easy to download, and nimble. The U-verse receiver directly retrieves and displays your web hosted content, so there is no need store large video files on the device.<\/li>\n<li>Remain in control of your content. You can update or remove content at any time without needing to communicate with the device.<\/li>\n<li>Have your app receive information about the programming being watched and respond intelligently.<\/li>\n<li>Make your app turn a mobile device into a TV remote control.<\/li>\n<li>Use the TV as a secondary or alternate screen and send UI elements to be rendered on the TV including compatible multimedia content like photos, music, and video.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Your Challenge:<\/strong>&nbsp;We are looking for creative mobile developers who want to take a test drive on the new U-verse Enabled platform. We will start you off with a sample application and all the testing equipment you will need. We will also provide tutorials on the SDK throughout the day. You will need to come up with a stellar edutainment app that shows off all the sick features of the U-verse Enabled platform. Embrace your inner geek child and create an app that is educational, but fun for a kid that is 2-10 years-old. The app should be iOS based and served from either a mobile phone or tablet device. You must use at least two distinct UvE API calls to be eligible for judging (e.g. host mode and remote control).<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in this challenge, we highly recommend becoming familiar with the SDK ahead of time.
