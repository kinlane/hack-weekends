Previous HackDays hackathons have seen the launch of new applications built with the APIs provided, developers finding new homes for their careers as well as the beginning of new startups. We are interested in working with you to build a bigger, stronger developer community in Vancouver, and were open to other creative ideas - so get in touch!<\/p>\n<p><span><strong>FAQ<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>So what are HackDays?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/ target=_blank>HackDays<\/a>&nbsp;are daily hackathons that&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/about\/ target=_blank>we<\/a>&nbsp;organize across Canada. We gather an awesome group of hackers\/developers who work either in a team or alone to build applications with publicly available APIs. We started with&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackto.ca\/ target=_blank>HackTO<\/a>&nbsp;in Toronto and had such a great time that we decided to roll out our hackathons across Canada. Our first destination outside of Toronto was Montreal. HackMTL was a&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/mtl.hackdays.ca\/2010\/12\/09\/hackmtl-was-a-blast-montreal-represented\/ target=_blank>blast<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/2011\/03\/hackott-ottawa-represented\/ target=_blank>HackOTT<\/a>&nbsp;and HackWaterloo followed hot on its heels!<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would like to participate what do I need?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First you need to register (right here on this page).&nbsp;This will ensure that you are guaranteed a spot for the hackathon. There is a $10 registration fee. This provides you with access to the event, breakfast, lunch, drinks, snacks and participation with awesome developers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who can participate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anyone who is interested in building an application. All you need to bring with you is your interest and motivation to get involved in building an application in a single day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Am I allowed to use third party APIs (APIs not provided via HackVAN) to build my application?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. But your usage of the third party APIs needs to be in addition to the HackVAN APIs. Also keep in mind that judging is partially based on utilization of the provided APIs, though, so their use should be prominent. So you can use any API you wish to use during HackVAN as long as you use at least one of the provided APIs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why should I participate in this hackathon?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question! When&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/about\/ target=_blank>Leila and Corey<\/a>&nbsp;started organizing hacking events in Toronto, they enjoyed meeting other like minded people, they enjoyed connecting them to other awesome people and learning about their interests, startups, and applications. They realized that everyone had a lot in common but most importantly: we were all builders. You want to participate because you are a builder and because you can&rsquo;t imagine a better use for your Saturday then setting yourself up in an awesome environment, surrounded by like minded people, building an application to stretches your tech skills, imagination and interests. That&rsquo;s why. You can always watch TV another day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if I don&rsquo;t know anyone or if I don&rsquo;t have any ideas as to what to build?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh that&rsquo;s an easy one: if you don&rsquo;t know anyone, that will last about 10 seconds once you join us. Seriously. Just come out and give it a try. I know you are shy and sometimes you need a kick in the a**. Consider this the kick in the a**. And as to ideas: not to worry, there will be plenty to choose from. The better question: will you have enough time to build your application and showcase it to the judges at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if I have an idea and a team already?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, we want to see you at HackVAN. That&rsquo;s a great start. Bring your team. Bring your idea. And get working as soon as you get to HackVAN. Perhaps we will be able to witness the birth of your startup.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How large can my team be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Teams can be as large or as small as you like. Solo is okay, too. A 2-3 people team is ideal typically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now I love hacking events but what do I win if I build the best application ever?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HackVAN is not just all guts. There is glory and&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/hackdays.ca\/2011\/04\/hackwaterloo-prizes\/ target=_blank>prizes<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><strong>What shall I expect when I get to HackVAN? What shall I bring and what does the schedule look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Expect that you will be spending the day with 60-80 other developers who are as keen as you are to build an application in a day and compete.

Your collaborative contributions will be documented and youll be able to continue working with the standard and&nbsp;API through a central Github repo.<\/p>\n<p>We will feed you good food from real chefs :)<\/p>\n<p>Food and drinks will be provided. &nbsp;A working lunch and then dinner\/drinks\/demos at around 6pm.<\/p>\n<p>But it wont be the usual hackathon fare. &nbsp;Real chefs will cook some killer dishes, and youll be well fed.<br \/>Cost &amp; DonationsWe ask everyone to throw $10 in the kitty to pay for the two delicious meals well be enjoying, and to show that youre serious about spending the day moving Open Food Data forward.<\/p>\n<p>For those with food issues who just want to hack, you can choose the no meals option, but we really want everyone to break bread together.<\/p>\n<p>Feel passionate about making standards and APIs around food data a reality?
