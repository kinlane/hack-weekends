Prior to the hackathon you can create your design, wireframes, logo, and user flows. You can even build hardware. But to make things completely fair you can not write any code whatsoever until the hackathon starts. All code must be built at AngelHack. <br \/><br \/>For more info visit our <a rel=nofollow href=http:\/\/www.angelhack.com\/rules>Rules<\/a> and <a rel=nofollow href=http:\/\/www.angelhack.com\/FAQ>FAQ<\/a> pages.<\/p>\n<p>Good Luck,<br \/>Gregory Gopman<br \/>AngelHack Founder \/ CEO<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>As seen in<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","start_date":"Dec 01 2012 17:00:00","display_start_date":"12-01-2012","end_date":"Dec 03 2012 01:00:00","display_end_date":"12-02-2012","url":"http:\/\/eventful.com\/venice_ca\/events\/angelhack-fall-2012-la-\/E0-001-051477027-0","address":"1600 Main St.","city":"Venice","state":"CA","zip":"","country":"United States"}]}
