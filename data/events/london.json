{"events":[{"name":"IDEATHON","about":"<p style=line-height: normal; padding: 0px 0px 8px; margin: 0px; text-align: left;><strong>What in tarnation is an Ideathon?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s like this. You&rsquo;ve got an idea, but it&rsquo;s just that - An idea.&nbsp; No business model. No brand. No real clue as to how to move forward with it. Ring any bells?! An ideathon is a chance to pitch that idea and, in an afternoon, go from nothing to something.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What if I don&rsquo;t have an idea?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to team up with someone with a great concept, this is a fantastic opportunity to hear lots of pitches and get involved at the earliest stage of development. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Who should come?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span>If you have an idea<\/span><\/strong>&ndash; pitch it at one of our events, join forces with people to help develop your idea from nothing to something and maybe even meet your new Co-Founder!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><span>If you don&rsquo;t-&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><span>have a current project, you&rsquo;ll get to hear a load of pitches &amp; you&rsquo;ll get to work on the one you like &ndash; helping to develop it in any way you can &ndash; and again, maybe you&rsquo;ll meet the yin to your yang... the Bonnie to your Clyde... the Adrian to your Rocky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>How&rsquo;s it different?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our events are about rolling up your sleeves and developing a business concept. But! It&rsquo;s not a hackathon. It&rsquo;s almost a pre-hackathon. The emphasis is less on building something and more on developing a concept in any way possible, whether it&rsquo;s a business model, a pitch, a demo, and MVP, UX sketches... You name it.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What&rsquo;s the catch?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;We want to keep it small and high quality, so sign up now before it&rsquo;s too late.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>And Finally...<\/strong>&nbsp;<br \/>Be sure to join our community on Meetup to meet other like-minded individuals!<br \/>&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/bit.ly\/SmGmHL target=_blank>http:\/\/bit.ly\/SmGmHL<\/a><\/p>","start_date":"Feb 16 2013 21:00:00","display_start_date":"02-16-2013","end_date":"Feb 17 2013 01:00:00","display_end_date":"02-16-2013","url":"http:\/\/ideathon2-SRCH.eventbrite.com","address":"5 Bonhill Street","city":"London","state":"England","zip":"EC2A","country":"United Kingdom"},{"name":"Titanium AppCamp 2013","about":"<p>Titanium AppCamp is a dedicated Titanium Mobile free unconference meets hackathon event.
