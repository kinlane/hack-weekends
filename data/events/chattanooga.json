{"events":[{"name":"Ignite Chattanooga Hack Days","about":"<p><img src=http:\/\/dvzglhsjiqlv0.cloudfront.net\/posts\/chattanooga-skyline-night.jpg alt= \/><\/p>\n<p>In a world with universal, ultra high-speed networks, all our assumptions about the web can be reset. What kinds of apps can we build when data can travel as fast as it needs to and processing power is never a bottleneck? The GigCity is going to find out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join Mozilla, US Ignite and a crew of forward-thinking technologists September 14-16th for a weekend of innovation, coding and fun. Leveraging the power of Chattanooga&rsquo;s Gigabit network, we&rsquo;ll spend two days prototyping the apps of the future. And well get a glimpse at the new experiences made possible by next-generation networks and our own ingenuity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you plan, build or design for the web, we want you! This is not a spectator sport, so plan to get your hands dirty.<\/p>\n<h2>What will happen?<\/h2>\n<p>Hackanooga is a participatory event focused on making and doing. We want running code, not just cool concepts. Less yak, more hack.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of two days we&rsquo;ll code, collaborate and kick ass! We&rsquo;ll eat pancake breakfasts, laugh over midnight marshmallows, and hack furiously into the wee hours. Hackanooga will provide you with meals, snacks, general merriment and even a place to nap over the course of the weekend, so you can focus on your team&rsquo;s app.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the event, we&rsquo;ll revel in the fruits of our collective handiwork and make plans to join forces again. Plus, prototypes created during the event could evolve into submissions to the Mozilla Ignite challenge, with $500,000 of seed money and mentorship available to help get the apps off the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Up for the challenge?<\/p>\n<h2>Hack yes!

It is for anyone who has ever had frustrations with some part of our transportation systems and thought, there has to be a better way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What the heck is a hack-a-thon anyway?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A hack-a-thon is a event where programmers (geeks) meet to do collaborative computer programming. These hack-a-thons are very much in the spirit of collaboration and openness. In our case, this hack-a-thon is centered around the theme of transportation. Just in case you were wondering, no you dont have to be a programmer to attend. In fact, we need transportation users, professional, designers or just anyone interested to attend to make is event successful.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Chattanooga is a Code for America Brigade alpha city and this event is part of the Brigades <a href=http:\/\/codeforamerica.org\/code-across-america\/ target=_blank>Code Across America<\/a> event during which several other hack-a-thons across the country will be occuring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;Transportation Hack-a-thon&nbsp;&nbsp;discuss?<br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Transportation is a major metropolitan issue, with direct impacts on economic strength, environmental sustainability, and social equity. &nbsp;Recent advances in technology (&ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo;, mobile computing, open source software, open data and APIs, and spatial analysis) present an opportunity to improve mobility more immediately and at a lower cost than has ever been possible in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Submit and vote on transportation applications you would like to see in Chattanooga at <a href=http:\/\/hackchatt.uservoice.com\/>http:\/\/hackchatt.uservoice.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Open Chattanoogas Transportation Hack-a-thon will focus on major themes such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open transit data: What are the best practices for developers to use it and transit agencies to publish it?
