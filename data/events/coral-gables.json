UHack will take place at the end of National E-Week, Saturday February 23rd, and finish the next day, Sunday February 24th. Taking place at the University of Miami, we are open to any student from any educational institution who would like to win great prizes and take some time off their semester by making something fun and possibly win some great prizes from our amazing sponsors. All for&nbsp;<strong>free<\/strong>!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This year, we are embracing&nbsp;<strong>ART<\/strong>&nbsp;as a central theme for the apps designed this weekend. And by art, we mean all types of art and its interpretations. Want to make the instagram of music, or the Spotify of Images, or have you been thinking of something really cool with videos? Go ahead. This is your time to work on that side project youve been putting off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Interested in learning more?
