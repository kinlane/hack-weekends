Attendees are encouraged to come regardless of whether they already have a team to work with or nothing other than a great idea. Our hackathon will introduce you to the latest cutting edge tools to help deploy your own app with a website backend, fully hosted in the cloud.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The hackathon, October 12-13th, unites a unique community of civic leaders in order to power innovative ideas and the development of technology to help solve one of the city&rsquo;s greatest challenges: chronic absenteeism. One in five New York City school students&mdash;over 200,000--missed a month or more of school last year. Research shows that students who are chronically absent are significantly less likely to graduate from high school. In fact, 3 out of 4 students who are chronically absent in the sixth grade never graduate from high school, while ninth grade attendance is a better predictor of graduation than eighth grade test scores. This is why Mayor Bloomberg established the Truancy Task Force in 2010, bringing together the Department of Education and multiple other city agencies in a coordinated and systematic effort to help these students succeed in school and beyond. Last year, students in the Task Force&rsquo;s pilot schools gained nearly 12,000 days of school as compared to similar students.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The event will be a forum for some of the city&rsquo;s great minds and innovators to unlock the potential of new media and technology to help our city&rsquo;s nearly one million students get to school on time, every day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Learn more at:&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/truancy\/html\/home\/home.shtml>http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/truancy\/html\/home\/home.shtml<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span><span><strong>We Supply:<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;Quick presentations and&nbsp;<\/span><span>code samples that help to bo<\/span><span>otstrap your hacking, food to keep you going, and caffeine to keep you awake.

The weekend brings together people with different skillsets - primarily educators, software developers, graphics designers and business people - to build applications and develop a commercial case around them.<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of emails asking what Startup Weekend EDU is all about, how it works, etc. It&rsquo;s almost exactly like a traditional Startup Weekend (if there&nbsp;<em>is<\/em>&nbsp;such a thing as a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Startup Weekend), but with a few tweaks:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>All of the pitches on Friday and companies demoed on Sunday will be designed to solve problems in the education space, broadly defined&ndash;not restricted to K-12 or other &ldquo;formal&rdquo; education.<\/li>\n<li>EDU events add a fourth crucial participant category:&nbsp;<em>educator<\/em>. Who better to speak about problems in education than teachers? In fact, they&rsquo;re&nbsp;<em>so<\/em>&nbsp;well-suited to this task that we give them the authority to &ldquo;teacher approve&rdquo; Friday night pitches before they&rsquo;re opened up to general voting and team selection!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span>You may still be thinking,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;<\/em><\/span><em><span>As interesting as that sounds, I don&rsquo;t know how a<span>regular<\/span>&nbsp;Startup Weekend runs.&rdquo;<\/span><\/em><span>&nbsp;If so, here&rsquo;s the scoop:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Startup Weekend is no ordinary event. It where like-minded entrepreneurs gather for a weekend of company creation. In 54 hours, you take an initial idea from the Friday night pitches through to a mind-spinning startup company at the Sunday night finale.<\/p>\n<p>Just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s only developers; this isn&rsquo;t a mere&nbsp;<em>hackathon<\/em>. Hackthons produce products or features; Startup Weekends produce&nbsp;<strong>companies<\/strong>.&nbsp;Startup Weekenders are&nbsp;marketing maestros, design gurus, business development wizards, legal geniuses, and the specialists of startups, the jack of all trades coming together as one, creating a harmony that can only be envied by the corporate world.<\/p>\n<p>OK &ndash; so that may be slight sales mode, but it truly is all about bringing together knowledge of the local entrepreneurship scene and helping those in need find their footing in the world of startups.<\/p>\n<p>Friday night is all about networking and the pitches. Those with an idea who are brave enough will stand in front of 150 strangers and give a 1-minute elevator pitch to the crowd. The ideas that people like&ndash;<em>and want to work with<\/em>&ndash;then get created over the remainder of the weekend (and often beyond). You and your self-selected team will have approximately 48 hours to deliver a product and plan that can stand up to the harsh light of day. Mentors will be on hand throughout the time to help you fine tune the idea from a fledgling concept into a working company with huge potential in less than two days.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds intense? It is!<\/p>\n<p>Sunday night is where the jury panel comes in. Seasoned professionals who have been through the startup mill many times over will scrutinize and find the holes in the plan to evaluate your chances of real world succession.<\/p>\n<p>From there?
