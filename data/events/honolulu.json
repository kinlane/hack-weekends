{"events":[{"name":"Global Game Jam 2013","about":"<P>The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is the worlds largest game jam event. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that in today\u2019s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves in a multitude of ways using video games \u2013 it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games\u2026 while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. Although the event is heavily focused on programming, there are many other areas where people who don\u2019t code can contribute to a game.<\/P>\n<P>The structure of a jam is usually that everyone gathers on Friday late afternoon, watches a short video keynote with advice from leading game developers, and then a secret theme is announced. All sites worldwide are then challenged to make games based on that same theme, with games to be completed by Sunday afternoon. In January 2012, we had 242 location in 47 countries created over 2000 games in one weekend and became a Guinness World Record! The jam is known for helping foster new friendship, increase confidence and opportunities within the community. The jam is always an intellectual challenge. People are invited to explore new technology tools, trying on new roles in development and testing their skills to do something that requires them to design, develop create, test and make a new game in the time span of 48 hours.<\/P>\n<P>The GGJ is not a competition.<\/P>\n<P>GGJ is organized by the Global Game Jam, Inc., an international non-profit corporation based in San Luis Obispo, California, with a mission to foster game design and game education through innovative events.
