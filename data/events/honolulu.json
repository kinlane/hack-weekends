It is the largest community of passionate entrepreneurs.<BR><BR>The non-profit organization is headquartered in Seattle, Washington but Startup Weekend organizers and facilitators can be found in hundreds of cities around the world. From Mongolia to South Africa to London to Brazil, people around the globe are coming together for weekend long workshops to pitch ideas, form teams, and start companies.<BR><BR>All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams will be formed around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote), then it\u2019s a 54-hour frenzy of business model creation, market validation, content strategizing, designing, and coding. The weekend culminates with presentations in front of peers and local entrepreneurial leaders as another opportunity for critical feedback. Whether you are looking for feedback on an idea, a co-founder, specific skill sets, or a team to help you execute, all participants are guaranteed to end the weekend better prepared to navigate the chaotic, but fun world of startups. Startup Weekends are the perfect environment in which to test your idea and take the first steps towards launching your own startup.<\/FONT><\/P>\n<P><FONT SIZE=2><BR><\/FONT><\/P>\n<P><FONT FACE=Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif><STRONG>Refund Policy:<\/STRONG>\u00a0\u00a0No refunds will be granted within 7 days of the event if food and drink have already been ordered.
