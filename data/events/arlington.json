Register for both in one swoop by clicking here!<\/p>\n<p>For years, high quality information about one of our democracy&rsquo;s most critical activities has been nearly impossible to come by -- that is, until the&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/votinginfoproject.org\/>Voting Information Project <\/a>(VIP) was born. The Pew Center on the States launched this initiative in 2008 to become the 21st century transmission line between election offices and voters. VIP answers voters&rsquo; most common questions -- things like &ldquo;where do I vote?&rdquo;, &ldquo;who is on my ballot?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;how do I navigate the voting process?&rdquo; -- by making official information available in the places where voters are looking for it, whether online or on their mobile devices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, in this hot-button election year, Pew and their partners at Microsoft, Google, and AT&amp;T are inviting you to roll up your sleeves and help make a difference. On April 30, 2012, join Pew, Microsoft, the Sunlight Foundation, and many others as we unleash the potential of this amazing and timely collection of civic data.<\/p>\n<p>What tools do you need to be a better citizen? What app would get your friends out to the voting booth? What data would benefit your local board of elections?

For its fifth convening, Sunlight will host a weekend conference and accompanying hackathon on April 28-29 and April 30, respectively.<br \/><br \/>At TransparencyCamp 2012, attendees will lead sessions on issues surrounding government transparency, openness and accountability facing the country and global community. This &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; brings together government officials, technologists, journalists and grassroots advocates to share best practices on the ways new technologies and effective policies can make our government really work for the people. Over the years, TransparencyCamp served as the starting point for a number of national open government programs and initiatives, including CityCamp and CrisisCamps, as well as inspiring international TCamps around the globe.<br \/><br \/>More details and videos about TransparencyCamp are available at&nbsp;<a href=http:\/\/organizing.sunlightfoundation.com\/page\/m\/64f5887e\/28881025\/33b53b68\/680289dd\/2271861527\/VEsE\/ target=_blank>http:\/\/transparencycamp.org\/<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>Sunlight is also hosting a hackathon with The Pew Center on the States and Microsoft on Monday, April 30, focusing on civic data from the Voting Information Project.
