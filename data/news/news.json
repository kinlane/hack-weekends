The student-run MIT Techfair has partnered with Palo Alto’s Palantir to present HackMIT, a hackathon where “anything goes.  ” Web apps, mobile apps and hardware hacks are all welcome, the only catch is that the hacks must be computer-related.  Even better, projects will not be judged solely on skill, but rather creativity, technical difficulty, polish and usefulness.",

In just nine hours, a group of about 70 hackers generated seven really interesting hardware designs — all of which could now be turned into physical products that are ready to plug in and power up.  Like in a software hackathon, the goal in a hardware hackathon is to take an idea from concept to prototype in as little time as possible.  The big differences in a hardware hack are that the “prototype” is a set of manufacturing files (bill of materials, Gerbers, and solid models) and that projects are often judged not just on their innovation and utility, but also on how easily they could eventually be manufactured.  At stake in this hack: The OCP Foundation would help the winning team patent their design or take it to prototype.",

So, I share with you today the stories of the POV Hackathon.  POV, the incredible PBS documentary series, hosts this event for documentary filmmakers to connect with designers and developers in the tech community, collaborating to create web-native documentary work that challenges form and expands their stories.  In his welcome speech at the event, Adnaan Wasey, head of POV Digital, and organizer of the Hackathon, encouraged everyone to embrace this chance to work outside their comfort zone, noting that this was an opportunity to create something quickly, in only 30 hours, versus the months & years documentaries usually take.  POV Executive Director Simon Kilmurry also stressed the themes of the day in his welcome remarks: “Be bold and don’t be afraid to make mistakes and put yourself out on the line.",

So far, there are OpenHack chapters available in:\n \n The idea is simple: get any local developer(s) of any language or framework to come together once or twice a month to pair program (or solo program if they choose) on any project they want.  Bring your laptop and a project, or just show up and pair with some one on theirs.

The simple answer is “yes” – and the positive benefits of hackathons are now undeniable.    However, the benefits can be a little hard to quantify, making ROI tricky to measure objectively.  For example, hackathons provide a fantastic way to grow developer awareness of your API as a brand in and of itself, separate from your core business.  When the developers who attend your hackathon go back to their day jobs on Monday, they have added your API to their programming tool belts and will use it, when appropriate, in upcoming projects.",

There’s no question Spotify, launched by a group of enterprising Swedes in 2006, is blowing up: the number of active monthly users increased from 7.  4 million in November 2011 to 24 million in November 2012, and the platform boasts high engagement with its comprehensive music offerings.",

The event brought together more than 30        participants from top universities and institutes ranging from the        Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to the Nencki Institute of        Experimental Biology in Poland, as well as from start-ups and        established technology companies, to develop data analysis strategies        and tools based on the newly enhanced Allen Brain Atlas application        programming interface (API).  This hackathon stems from our longstanding, open approach to science        and our belief that putting our data-rich resources in the hands of the        many and varied experts around the globe is the most effective way to        drive progress in brain research, said Chinh Dang, Chief Technology        Officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science.  The hackathon        projects delivered innovative ways of handling data, offering direct        contributions to the informatics and programming communities as well as        to neuroscience.  We hope that this event serves as a springboard for        others out in the community to use our API, and we look forward to        seeing what can be done with it.",

He added that 60 percent of the projects from the hackathons last December and this past February and March were shipped, either internally or to Facebook users, including:\n Full-screen photos\n Photo filters for Facebook for Every Phone\n A 42-foot QR code on the roof of Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.  An internal timeline application that rewards engineers with a Pokemon each time they fix a bug\n \n At around 7 p.",

            "details": "  More than two dozen programmers, content specialists, designers and city officials from CivicPlus and the City of Joplin have worked tirelessly since the late April Hackathon to rebuild the City’s website.  Driven by the goal to launch the site by May 18th, four days before the “Day of Unity” which will commemorate the one-year anniversary of the EF-5 tornado that ravaged the city, the project team has already logged nearly 1,000 hours.  “Their cohesive efforts are compressing a project that normally would take four -to -six months into less than three weeks,” said Michael Ashford, CivicPlus community engagement evangelist.  “It’s another example of the ’Miracle of the Human Spirit’ that 135,000 volunteers have shown as we each do our part to rebuild Joplin.  ”     \n  Hackathon Judge and GovLoop.",

            "details": "  You might be forgiven if you thought a “hackathon” was an event where a bunch of hackers get together to plot the overthrow of the digital universe.  In reality, it’s a more innocuous event where developers and business people come together to focus on creating new types of applications.  The folks at Rally Software, a provider of application lifecycle management (ALM) software, hosted one of these this week at its annual RallyON conference, but you don’t really need a vendor to create your own “hackathon.  ” According to Todd Olson, vice president of products at Rally Software, Rally Software hosts these events as part of an effort to get people to focus on developing innovative applications.  Part of the problem that most companies have these days is that they are working so hard on managing the business that there is no time to think about how to improve the business.",
