Bringing together a nations worth of talent means upping the ante on prizes as well.  So this will also be the first hackathon to include the top prize of guaranteed seed capital investments to winning teams.  Whats the big deal?  Usually, hackathons finish when the last team presents in their home city.","item_date":"May 15 2012 17:34:49","display_item_date":"05-15-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/angelhack-announces-its-second-national-hackathon-with-50k-in-seed-funding-to-winning-teams-151532675.html","source":"www.prnewswire.com","tags":"Hackathon"},{"title":"The Boston Cleanweb Hackathon Rocked","details":"  I was absolutely blown away by how creative and productive the hackers were at this weekends cleanweb hackathon here in Boston.  As a recap: Around 15 teams of programmers and other hackers came together at Greentown Labs to spend 30 or so hours creating new cleantech-related web and mobile apps from scratch.  Most came in with ideas in mind, of course, but they had to write fresh code to compete.  Many worked through the night Saturday, and then, bleary-eyed and over-caffeinated, they presented their work on Sunday afternoon to a panel of entrepreneur and investor judges.  They were all scored on the categories of Impact, Originality, User Experience, and Completeness.","item_date":"May 14 2012 23:59:54","display_item_date":"05-14-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.greentechmedia.com\/cleantech-investing\/post\/the-boston-cleanweb-hackathon-rocked\/","source":"www.greentechmedia.com","tags":"Hackathon"},{"title":"CivicPlus Putting Hackathon Ideas to Work to Launch New City Website in Time for Joplin 'Day of Unity'","details":"  More than two dozen programmers, content specialists, designers and city officials from CivicPlus and the City of Joplin have worked tirelessly since the late April Hackathon to rebuild the City\u2019s website.  Driven by the goal to launch the site by May 18th, four days before the \u201cDay of Unity\u201d which will commemorate the one-year anniversary of the EF-5 tornado that ravaged the city, the project team has already logged nearly 1,000 hours.  \u201cTheir cohesive efforts are compressing a project that normally would take four -to -six months into less than three weeks,\u201d said Michael Ashford, CivicPlus community engagement evangelist.  \u201cIt\u2019s another example of the \u2019Miracle of the Human Spirit\u2019 that 135,000 volunteers have shown as we each do our part to rebuild Joplin.  \u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n  Hackathon Judge and GovLoop.","item_date":"May 14 2012 23:18:26","display_item_date":"05-14-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/2012\/5\/prweb9505717.htm","source":"www.prweb.com","tags":"Government, Hackathon, Public, Sector\/Government"},{"title":"Open Legislation Hackathon - June 2nd, 2012","details":"  What is it?

In reality, it\u2019s a more innocuous event where developers and business people come together to focus on creating new types of applications.  The folks at Rally Software, a provider of application lifecycle management (ALM) software, hosted one of these this week at its annual RallyON conference, but you don\u2019t really need a vendor to create your own \u201chackathon.  \u201d According to Todd Olson, vice president of products at Rally Software, Rally Software hosts these events as part of an effort to get people to focus on developing innovative applications.  Part of the problem that most companies have these days is that they are working so hard on managing the business that there is no time to think about how to improve the business.","item_date":"May 08 2012 21:47:57","display_item_date":"05-08-2012","url":"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=X&q=http:\/\/www.itbusinessedge.com\/cm\/blogs\/vizard\/time-to-host-a-hackathon-of-your-own\/%3Fcs%3D50344&ct=ga&cad=CAcQARgAIAEoATAAOABAte6l_QRIAlgAYgVlbi1VUw&cd=AcILAIHUSuU&usg=AFQjCNH0ZDlxtTTpfPv7xqsm0caP3i2UBw","source":"www.google.com","tags":"Alerts, Google, Hackathon"}]}
