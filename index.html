<p>Hackathons are a fast growing phenomenom where developers come together, usually in short periods up to 72 hours to submit ideas, form teams and hack together applications, data visualizations and sometimes form business models around their ideas.</p>

<p>For those that are new to the hackathon space, these events are not intended to perform illegal activities around computer networks. Software developers widely see hacking as a quick and dirty programming solution to a problem.  It is NOT about gaining access to other networks, which is a definition widely publicized by the media and hollywood.  Among the developer community, it is meant to be a positive term that drives innovation among developers.</p>

<p>This site is meant to provide an open resource for the hackathon community. Currently on Hack Weekends you will find:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hackathon Calendar - A listing of all future hackathons</li>
    <li>Hackathons by City - Breakdown of hackathons by city</li>
    <li>News - Other news about hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking to do more than attend hackathons and would like to organize or sponsor hackathons, visit the Hack Weekends about page for more information.</p>
<p>Hack Weekends is a community project, please help out where you can.</p>
